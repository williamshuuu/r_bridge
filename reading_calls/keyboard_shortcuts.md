# Keyboard Shortcuts 

The Rstudio team maintains a really great series of one-page resources for many of the major projects in R and Rstudio. They are located on this [cheatsheets](https://rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) website.

- Particularily relevant at this point is the cheatsheet that describes how to interact with the [Rstudio IDE](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/main/rstudio-ide.pdf). 
- We have also saved a frozen copy of this cheatsheet in the course repo (./resources/cheatsheet-rstudio_ide.pdf).
